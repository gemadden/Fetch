# Fetch

## Requirements

*Python 3* and *PyGame* are required to run **Fetch**.

To install *PyGame*, run the following from the terminal:

```
pip install pygame
```

If *Python* is not available on your system, a Windows executable is also available in the file "fetchPyInstallerWindows.zip". Unzip this file and run *fetch.exe* to play the game.

## How to Play

From the terminal, run the following:

```
python3 fetch.py
```

From the title screen, select which dog you would like to play with and then select level 1.

When the game starts, use the arrow keys to control your dog, moving them to collect as many tennis balls as possible. However, be careful to avoid any chocolate bars, as these can hurt you.
